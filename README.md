A **keylogger** (short for **keystroke logger**) is a type of surveillance technology or software that records every keystroke made on a keyboard. Keyloggers can be either hardware- or software-based, and they are often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes.

### üü¢ **Legitimate Uses:**
- **Employee Monitoring:** In workplaces, to ensure productivity and monitor computer usage.
- **Parental Control:** To monitor children's online activity and keep them safe.
- **Personal Activity Logging:** Some people use it to keep track of their own typing activity (e.g., writing logs or recovering lost text).
- **Troubleshooting and Usability Testing:** In software development to identify issues and improve user interfaces.

### üî¥ **Malicious Uses:**
- **Data Theft:** Stealing sensitive information like usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and personal messages.
- **Cyber Espionage:** Used by hackers to gain access to confidential information.
- **Identity Theft:** Collecting information to impersonate the victim online.

### üö¶ **Types of Keyloggers:**
1. **Software Keyloggers:**
   - Operate as background applications, recording keystrokes and sometimes taking screenshots.
   - Can be installed through malicious software or phishing attacks.
2. **Hardware Keyloggers:**
   - Physical devices placed between the keyboard and the computer or embedded within keyboards.
   - Harder to detect through antivirus software.
3. **Network-based Keyloggers:**
   - Monitor network packets to capture keystroke data sent over the internet.
4. **Kernel-based Keyloggers:**
   - Operate at the core of the operating system, making them difficult to detect.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Prevention and Protection:**
- **Use Anti-Malware and Anti-Virus Software:** To detect and block keylogger software.
- **Regularly Update Software:** Including operating systems and security applications.
- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Adds an extra layer of security.
- **Monitor Input Devices:** For physical hardware keyloggers.
- **Use Virtual Keyboards:** Especially when entering sensitive information.
